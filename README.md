# General info
This repository contains some calculations based on neural networks. 
## Henon Heiles system and
*Phase space coordinates of the Henon Heiles system have been considered as input to the neural network.  The goal is to learn the underlying distribution of the systems coordinate and generate new coordinate with the help of a variational autoencoder neural network. The input data has been provided by Dr. [Loris Di Cairano]. (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Loris-Di-Cairano)

## Orbital trajectory of planets around sun
* The data consist of the trajectory of planets around the sun and the goal is to predict the time series behaviour of this planetary move.
  The data has been provided by Dr. [Dahvyd Wing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uahmj0rr37629jd/planets_trajectories.npz?dl=0).  A LSTM neural network has been used to predict the next coordinates of a planet (Mercury).
