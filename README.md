# General info
This repository contains some calculations based on neural networks. 
## Henon Heiles system and
*Phase space coordinates of the Henon Heiles system have been considered as input to the neural network.  The goal is to learn the underlying distribution of the systems coordinate and generate new coordinate with the help of a variational autoencoder neural network.
